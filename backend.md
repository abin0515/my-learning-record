# Internet
## How does the internet work?
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols, primarily TCP/IP. When you request awebpage, your device sends a data packet through your internet service provider (ISP) to a DNS server, which translates the website's domain name into an IP address. The packet is then routed across various networks (using routers and switches) to the destination server, which processes the request and sends back the response. 

**Summary: The internet is a global computer network that communicates via TCP/IP protocols; when you request a webpage, your device sends data packets through DNS resolution and routing to reach the target server, which then returns the re quested information.**

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext via the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. HTTP operates on a request-response model: a client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server for resources, such as web pages or files, and the server responds with the requested content and an HTTP status code indicating the result of the request. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent and does not retain information about previous interactions. It forms the foundation of data communication on the web and is typically used with secure HTTP (HTTPS) for encrypted communication.

**Summary: HTTP is a stateless request-response protocol that governs how web browsers and servers communicate; it defines how web content is requested, formatted, transmitted, and received, forming the foundation of data exchange on the World Wide Web.**

## What is domain name?
A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a specific location on the internet, making it easier to access websites and online services. It translates to an IP address, which is a numerical identifier used by computers to locate and connect to servers. A domain name consists of two main parts: the second-level domain (e.g., "example" in "example.com") and the top-level domain (e.g., ".com"). Domain names are managed by domain name registrars and are essential for establishing a web presence, providing a user-friendly way to navigate to websites instead of using numeric IP addresses.

**Summary: Domain names are human-readable internet addresses that map to numeric IP addresses; they consist of second-level and top-level domains (like example.com) and serve as user-friendly identifiers that eliminate the need to remember complex IP numbers when accessing websites.**

## What is hosting?
Hosting refers to the service of providing server space and resources for storing and delivering website files and applications to users over the internet. Hosting providers offer the infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and network connectivity, required to make websites and applications accessible online. There are various types of hosting, including shared hosting (where multiple websites share a single server), virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated hosting (where a single server is dedicated to one user), and cloud hosting (which uses a network of servers to provide scalable resources). Hosting services often include domain registration, security features, and technical support to ensure websites are reliably available and perform well.

**Summary: Hosting is a service that provides server space and technical infrastructure to store website files and make them accessible online; it comes in various types (shared, VPS, dedicated, cloud) and typically includes resources for storage, connectivity, security, and support to ensure website availability.**

## DNS and how it works?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical, decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other. DNS servers distributed worldwide work together to resolve these queries, forming a global directory service. The system uses a tree-like structure with root servers at the top, followed by top-level domain servers (.com, .org, etc.), authoritative name servers for specific domains, and local DNS servers. DNS is crucial for the functioning of the Internet, enabling users to access websites and services using memorable names instead of numerical IP addresses. It also supports email routing, service discovery, and other network protocols.

**Summary: DNS is a hierarchical naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses; it works through a global network of servers organized in levels (root, TLD, authoritative, local) that work together to resolve queries, allowing users to access websites using memorable names rather than numeric addresses.**


## Browsers and how they work?
Web browsers are software applications that enable users to access, retrieve, and navigate information on the World Wide Web. They interpret and display HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages. Modern browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge offer features such as tabbed browsing, bookmarks, extensions, and synchronization across devices. They incorporate rendering engines (e.g., Blink, Gecko, WebKit) to process web content, and JavaScript engines for executing code. Browsers also manage security through features like sandboxing, HTTPS enforcement, and pop-up blocking. They support various web standards and technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and Web APIs, enabling rich, interactive web experiences. With the increasing complexity of web applications, browsers have evolved to become powerful platforms, balancing performance, security, and user experience in the ever-changing landscape of the internet.

**Summary: Web browsers are applications that translate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visual web pages; they use specialized rendering engines (like Blink, Gecko, WebKit) and JavaScript engines to process content, while providing features for navigation, security, and customization through extensions, making them sophisticated platforms for accessing and interacting with web content.**

# Language
## JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It runs in the browser, allowing for client-side scripting that can manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user events, and interact with web APIs. JavaScript is also used on the server side with environments like Node.js, enabling full-stack development. 

**Summary: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used in both frontend and backend development, enhancing webpage interactivity in browsers and enabling server-side development through Node.js.**

## Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, robustness, and scalability.It's widely used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, and web services. Java features automatic memory management (*garbage collection*), a vast standard library, and strong security features, making it a popular choice for backend systems, distributed applications, and cloud-based solutions.

**Summary: Java is a "write once, run anywhere" object-oriented language, renowned for its reliability and cross-platform capabilities, widely used in enterprise systems and Android application development.**
