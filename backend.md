## Internet
# How does the internet work?
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols, primarily TCP/IP. When you request awebpage, your device sends a data packet through your internet service provider (ISP) to a DNS server, which translates the website's domain name into an IP address. The packet is then routed across various networks (using routers and switches) to the destination server, which processes the request and sends back the response. 

**Summary: The internet is a global computer network that communicates via TCP/IP protocols; when you request a webpage, your device sends data packets through DNS resolution and routing to reach the target server, which then returns the requested information.**


# JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It runs in the browser, allowing for client-side scripting that can manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user events, and interact with web APIs. JavaScript is also used on the server side with environments like Node.js, enabling full-stack development. 

**Summary: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used in both frontend and backend development, enhancing webpage interactivity in browsers and enabling server-side development through Node.js.**

# Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, robustness, and scalability.It's widely used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, and web services. Java features automatic memory management (*garbage collection*), a vast standard library, and strong security features, making it a popular choice for backend systems, distributed applications, and cloud-based solutions.

**Summary: Java is a "write once, run anywhere" object-oriented language, renowned for its reliability and cross-platform capabilities, widely used in enterprise systems and Android application development.**
