# Binary Tree
To start with, we can summarize that there are main thinking patterns for solving binary tree problems.
1.Traverse mindset: 
Think about it, can you obtain the answer by traversing the tree once? If so, implement a **traverse** function that updates an external variable as you go--this is the traversal approach.
2.Divide and conquer: 
Can you define a recursive function whose return value for each subtree leads directly to the answer for the whole tree? If so, write out that recursive function's signature and make full use of its return value--this is the **divide and conquer** approach.
