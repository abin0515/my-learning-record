JavaScript:
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It runs in the browser, allowing for client-side scripting that can manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user events, and interact with web APIs. JavaScript is also used on the server side with environments like Node.js, enabling full-stack development.
